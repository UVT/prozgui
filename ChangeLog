Changes in version 2.0.5beta
------------------------
The threads now all download to a single file, so now there is no need for 
a lengthy and slow download joining process. Also this saves the hard disk 
space.

Applied Ralphs patch which fixes several wrong links to delrom.ro and has 
changed them to genesys.ro 


Changes in version 2.0.4beta3
------------------------

Filesearching.com was added to the ftpsearch server list as the default as
lycos.com has stopped there service.

Start, Stop and Remove from list buttons added to the menu. The list of
downloads is aved to a file as well, so it is saved between sessions. The
Stop button is not yet operational.

Eric Lassauge <ros_at1@muzillac.tls.mms.fr> submitted a patch which added
a french translation and also corrected several grammatical errors in my
code (Thanks Eric)

Changes in version 2.0.4beta2
------------------------

The URL parsing code was changed.

The Start Download button in the ftpsearch Window allows the user to abort 
the ftpsearch or ping prior to it being completed. 

ftpsearch.uniovi.es added as another ftpsearch server (but it doesn't seem 
to contain as much results as lycos)

libprozilla has improved error handling for multiple server based 
downloads.

Emanuele Tatti's updated itallian translation was added.

If no mirrors are found the ftpsearch window is closed.

configure now checks for sys/stat.h as on solaris this wasnt being 
included : Keith Leng <keith@keith-leng.demon.co.uk>    

Changes in version 2.0.4-beta
------------------------
Support for FTPSearch and pinging to select the fastest server(s).

Multiple server downloads, based on the ftpsearch results prozilla will 
make multiple connections to different servers and download the file 
simultaneously, this should give you a further speed increase.

Itallian translation by  Emanuele Tatti <emanu_mary@inwind.it> added.

A bug in which HTTP-PROXY was not selectable in the http-proxy preferences
was fixed.

Improved error handling while downloading.

Alberto Zanoni <alberto.zanoni@tiscalinet.it> helped to fix a compilation
error and several warnings in prozgui.

Usual Bugfixes.

Changes in version 2.0.2 
------------------------ 

The we.cxx file generated by FLUID was not compatible with the fltk
-1.0.10 library (it refused to compile), so it was regenerated by FLUID
1.0.9 and it is fixed now. Thanks to David L. Matthews <dlm@wam.umd.edu>
for reporting this.

A cool progress bar was added, it was based on the progress bar available 
at the FLTK bazar. Its slightly modified so as to add a textual progress 
display on top of the bar  as well. 

The password during FTP transfers is hidden, if it is not annonymous, this 
was based on a suggestion by Calin Damian <calin@work.ro>.

The romanian translation by Flower for the GUI was available today and has 
been added, now prozilla GUI  should speak romanian.

Added the manpage which was written by Gustavo.

Gustavo's libtoolising patch for libprozilla was added :)

        * Added KoV's portugese translation and we now have portugese
	  prozila, slight cosmetic changes were necessary since it appears

          the text.

	  FLTK one.
